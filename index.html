<h2 style="border: 7px solid turquoise;"> A bottlenose dolphin flips its tail as it swims with its dolphin friends.<br> A baby chimpanzee watches closely as its mom shows it how to crack a nut.<br>A male wolf howls to gather the pack for a hunt. </h2> 
<h2 style="border: 7px solid turquoise;">Playing, teaching, and working together are known as "social skills".<br>Humans, of course are social animals.<br> So are bottlenose dolphins, chimps, and wolves.<br> And according to scientists, it's time to move one animal higher up the list: ORCAS! </h2>
<h2 style="background-color: springgreen;">You'd need more than 650 cans of tuna to keep an orca full!</h2>
<h1 style="border: 7px solid turquoise;">ORCAS "ADOPT" ORPHANS.</h1>
<h2 style="border: 7px solid turquoise;">Springer watched curiously as a boat approached her.<br> The young orca had been orphaned as a calf, so no one had taught her that boat propellers can injure her.<br>Wanting to take a closer look, Springer swam closer until ....whoosh!<br>An older female orca called Nodales forcefully shoved her away from danger.<br>"Nodales took Springer under her wing, even though they weren't related",<br> says Paul Spong, co-director of OrcaLab, a research station in Canada.<br>"It didn't take long for the young orca to understand she should keep away from boats."<br> Today Springer is a mother herself-and she stays out of water traffic.</h2>
<h2 style="background-color: springgreen;">An orca's diet consists of whales, sea lions, penguins, seals, walruses, and a variety of fish and squid. Chomp! </h2>
<h1 style="border: 7px solid turquoise;">ORCAS "BABYSIT" OTHER ORCAS.</h1>
<h2 style="border: 7px solid turquoise;">One day a female named Sharky moved close to a group of newborn orcas and their mothers.<br>Sharky swam near a calf, then led it away to play with her-giving the moms a break.<br> Waite observed Sharky behave like that with other calves as well.<br>"She's not the only young female we've seen 'babysit' other orcas," Waite says.<br> We think they do it as a practice for when they have calves of their own."</h2>
<h2 style="background-color: springgreen;"> Orcas don't often dive very deep-their food is usually near the surface, so they are as well.</h2>
